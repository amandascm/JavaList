**Each problem was implemented as a Java package and they all have a class named 'Main'**. To compile and execute each of them, do:
```sh
$ cd src
$ javac -d . Qx.java
$ java qx.ClassName
```
Where **x** represents the problem number. Here's an example of problem 1 compilation and of its class 'Main' execution:
```sh
$ cd src
$ javac -d . Q1.java
$ java q1.Main
```
